# PHAT Examples

The development of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems is a challenging one. Itâ€™s is inherently expensive because of, among others, the necessary experi-mentation and availability of hardware, the uncertainty in the determining the necessary functionality which leads to longer development periods, the need of incorporating the end-user in the development so as to have early feedback, and, at the same time, the complexity of preserving the end-user dignity, privacy, and integrity.

By transferring the development work of the AAL solution to the computer, several benefits are achieved. The main one is the cost reduction since the development environment is not a demanding one and computers designed for gaming will be sufficient. A secondary one is the easiness of experimentation, with the capability of running batteries of tests in a deterministic way.

This development philosophy is what we call Virtual Living Lab This transfer has to exist in both directions. It is not only bringing the problem to the computer. It is also being capable of taking out a working solution from the computer. Both transfers are challenging because they imply reproducing the hardware inside the simulation in a convincing way.

The following examples are proposed to work with 3D simulations where older people perform basic activities that can be studied applying HAR techniques.

## Fetching all examples

This repository is an aggregator of various other ones, which are defined as git submodules for this project. In order to fetch all the examples in one go, you should perform the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mfcardenas/phat_examples.git
cd phat_examples
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
